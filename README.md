# Kubernetes Failure Prediction Application

A Streamlit-based machine learning application that predicts failures in Kubernetes clusters through analysis of historical metrics data. This tool helps DevOps teams proactively identify potential node crashes, resource exhaustion, and other common failure scenarios before they impact production systems.

## Ideology

The Kubernetes Failure Prediction Application is built on the principle of **proactive maintenance** rather than reactive troubleshooting. Its core ideology centers around:

### Predictive Over Reactive
Traditional Kubernetes monitoring focuses on alerting after problems occur. Our approach shifts the paradigm by predicting failures before they happen, giving operations teams critical time to address issues before they impact users.

### Multi-model Intelligence
No single algorithm can capture all failure patterns. By combining classification, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting, we create a more comprehensive understanding of system health than any single approach could provide.

### Explainable AI
Black-box predictions are insufficient for critical infrastructure. Our models provide clear explanations of why predictions are made, highlighting which metrics contributed most to failure predictions and enabling targeted remediation.

### Continuous Learning
Kubernetes environments evolve constantly. The application is designed to incorporate new data and refine its models over time, adapting to changing workloads and infrastructure patterns.

## Innovative Approach

The application takes several innovative approaches to Kubernetes monitoring and failure prediction:

### Hybrid Model Architecture
Unlike standard monitoring tools that use threshold-based alerts or basic statistical models, our application employs a hybrid approach that combines:

1. **Classification-based prediction** (Random Forest) for pattern recognition of known failure scenarios
2. **Anomaly detection** (Isolation Forest) for identifying novel and previously unseen failure patterns
3. **Time series forecasting** (ARIMA) for predicting future metric values and trends

This three-pronged approach provides more reliable predictions than any single model could achieve.

### Feature Engineering Pipeline
The application implements automated feature engineering that captures temporal patterns in Kubernetes metrics, generating rolling statistics, trend indicators, and inter-metric relationships that simple monitoring tools miss.

### Adaptive Threshold Learning
Rather than relying on static thresholds, the models learn optimal decision boundaries from historical data, adapting to the specific characteristics of each cluster and workload profile.

### Integrated Workflow
The end-to-end pipeline from data collection to visualization creates a seamless experience, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools for monitoring, analysis, and prediction.

## Model Architecture & Technical Details

### Random Forest Classifier

The Random Forest model is used for classification-based prediction of Kubernetes failures. It works by:

1. Creating multiple decision trees during training
2. Using majority voting to make final predictions

**Key Parameters:**
- Number of estimators (trees): 50-300 (configurable)
- Maximum depth: 5-30 (configurable)
- Class weights: Automatically adjusted for imbalanced datasets

### Isolation Forest

The Isolation Forest model is used for anomaly detection in Kubernetes metrics. It:

1. Isolates observations by randomly selecting features
2. Creates shorter paths for anomalies compared to normal observations
3. Identifies potential failures without relying on historical failure labels

**Key Parameters:**
- Contamination: Automatically calculated based on expected failure rate
- Number of estimators: 50-300 (configurable)

### ARIMA Time Series Model

The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is used for forecasting future metrics values and detecting trends. It:

1. Captures temporal patterns in metrics data
2. Forecasts future values based on historical patterns
3. Helps identify potential deviations that could indicate upcoming failures
